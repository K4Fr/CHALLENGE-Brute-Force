# CHALLENGE-Brute-Force

Credit to g4143 for the challenge.

"Instructions for the challenge: Take the program and use brute force to crack the password. Yup create a program that generates a list of passwords and checks if the program below exits with a return value of 0 or EXIT_SUCCESS.

Here's the constraint(s).
1. You can only execute the above program once and use brute force to crack the password.

What you can't do:

1. Modify the program.

2. Create a program that generates a list of passwords and keeps executing the above program for each password. This scenario will execute the above program more than once. 

So in a nutshell - You must create a program that generates a list of passwords and loads the above program into memory and executes it once but checks each password from the generated list until it exits with 0 or EXIT_SUCCESS.

Note: The challenge is not really about generating passwords. The challenge is executing the above program once but passing all the passwords to it until it exits with 0 or EXIT_SUCCESS.

This is not for the rookies. Good luck and if you have any questions please post them. G4143"
